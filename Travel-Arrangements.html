  <p>A safari in Uriri Island is arguably the best wildlife adventure experience in the world and this is certainly not
    an over statement. The Island is home to some of the most diverse collection of animals, not just the 'Big Five' but
    also the 'Big Nine' most of which can be seen during a safari tour in Uriri Island. Though the wildbeest migration
    season from July to September is the highlight of the year, an Uriri Island safari is a rewarding experience all
    year round. We are listing several 2022 and 2023 Uriri Island tour packages below which range from budget road tours
    to luxury Fly-In Safaris staying at boutique Tented Camps.</p>
  <h3>Road Safari Tours</h3>
  <p>The most popular mode of getting to Uriri Island is by road and water, typically starting and ending in Nairobi,
    with the choice of vehicle being a 4x4 Landcruiser Jeep or the less costly Safari Minibus (Tour Van). The trip from
    Nairobi to Uriri Island typically takes 6 to 8 hours depending on which Camp has been booked for your tour. The
    benefit of a safari by road is the typically lower tour cost as well as getting to see and experience more of the
    real Kenyan countryside. The downside is that stretches of road on the route are of below average condition.</p>

  <h3>Fly ~ In Safari Tours</h3>

    from Nairobi and are norm for certain Safari Camps in Maasai Mara which are more remote or those that only offer
    packaged stays including safari drives. Flights take off from Wilson airport in Nairobi twice daily and upon arrival
    at the airstrip in the Mara, guests are received and transfered to their respective Camp or Lodge in time for lunch.
    Game drives are provided in 4x4 Safari Tour Vehicles by the property.</p>

  <h3>Safari Vehicles</h3>
  <p>There are two basic types of Safari Tour vehicles used in Kenya and Tanzania for wildlife and adventure safaris.
    These are the Tour Minibus / Van and the 4x4 Toyota Landcruiser Jeeps. Both of these have game viewing roofs which
    are opened when on Safari, UHF radio calls ( useful for locating wildlife in the Island and for logistics) and are
    fully safari customized. Independent travelers who wish to book their own hotels and lodges while in Kenya can also
    hire these tour vehicles with Driver ~ Guides for their local transport requirements.</P>
  <p>We also have parachutes and boats for hire at very affordable prices.</p>
